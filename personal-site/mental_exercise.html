                <h4>Look for Mental Distortions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A few things to watch for in your thinking patterns. Write the
                        following down when you start to experience them</li>
                    <li>All or nothing Thinking: black and white thinking. If it is not perfect
                        it is a failure</li>
                    <li>Over generalization: Constant thinking of failure. </li>
                    <li>Over focus: Over dwelling on past mistakes.</li>
                    <li>Pushing out the Positive: Positive experiences are not enough.</li>
                    <li>Jumping to conclusions: thinking that others think you are a failure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Box Breathing</h4>
                <p>Focus on your breathing. If you are having a panic attack focus on
                    holding your breath for 6 seconds and then breathe out slowly.
                    Repeat the process until the panic attack has passed. This is a good
                    exercise even if you are not having a panic attack. You can slow a
                    racing mind and create healthy thinking patterns.</p>

                <h4>Create a Worry Tree</h4>
                <p>Create a worry tree by starting what you are worrying about. Then
                    ask questions to yourself about if you can fix the problem. Then
                    branch off from your answers . For example if you can't do anything
                    about it then let it go. If you can then aske yourself when it comes
                    up, what is it, and the how behind it and branch off until you find
                    solutions to the worry.</p>

                <h4>Monitor Eating and Sleep Patterns</h4>
                <p>Diet and sleep can effect your minds in many different ways. Sleep
                    can make you more tired. Being tired you are more likely to make
                    mistakes making you feel less of yourself. Healthy dieting can help
                    give your brain the help it needs to think clearly and make positive
                    decisions. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water and eating
                    plenty of veggies and fruit. Eating excess sugar will slow your brain
                    down and make you feel drowsy. </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to help people who are struggling with any form of mental illness to find help. Mental Health is a 
        big issue that needs to be addressed. 1 in 4 people suffer from some kind of mental illness. I want to make a website that connects 
        people to different resources and exercises. People from all walks of life need help with mental needs and it is becoming more of an 
        issue. Having a healthy mind can make all the difference and allow everyone to enjoy life without the mental illness weighing them down. 
        Mental illness can affect our relationships, career, and families. I want to be able to reach out to as many people as possible and 
        help people just like me. I myself have struggled with Anxiety and Depression. I want to share what has helped me and pass it on to 
        other people that are struggling and make the world a better place for all.    </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>It can be hard to find help when you feel alone. 
        I want to help as many people as I can with mental health because I also have some mental illnesses. I have anxiety and depression. I want people to be able to find the resources
        that are available. Mental health is important for everyone and any age. It effects men and women. It is also a growing concern.</p>  <!-- change this -->

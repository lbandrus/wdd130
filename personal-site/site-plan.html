      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to help people who are struggling with any form of mental illness to find help. Mental Health is a 
        big issue that needs to be addressed. 1 in 4 people suffer from some kind of mental illness. I want to make a website that connects 
        people to different resources and exercises. People from all walks of life need help with mental needs and it is becoming more of an 
        issue. Having a healthy mind can make all the difference and allow everyone to enjoy life without the mental illness weighing them down. 
        Mental illness can affect our relationships, career, and families. I want to be able to reach out to as many people as possible and 
        help people just like me. I myself have struggled with Anxiety and Depression. I want to share what has helped me and pass it on to 
        other people that are struggling and make the world a better place for all.    </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>It can be hard to find help when you feel alone. 
        I want to help as many people as I can with mental health because I also have some mental illnesses. I have anxiety and depression. I want people to be able to find the resources
        that are available. Mental health is important for everyone and any age. It effects men and women. It is also a growing concern.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Mental Exercises</h3>
      <p>
        A few things to watch for in your thinking patterns. Write the
        following down when you start to experience them.
        All or nothing Thinking: black and white thinking. If it is not perfect
        it is a failure
        Over generalization: Constant thinking of failure.
        Over focus: Over dwelling on past mistakes.
        Pushing out the Positive: Positive experiences are not enough.
        Jumping to conclusions: thinking that others think you are a failure.
        Box Breathing
        Focus on your breathing. If you are having a panic attack focus on
        holding your breath for 6 seconds and then breathe out slowly.
        Repeat the process until the panic attack has passed. This is a good
        exercise even if you are not having a panic attack. You can slow a
        racing mind and create healthy thinking patterns.
        Create a Worry Tree
        Create a worry tree by starting what you are worrying about. Then
        ask questions to yourself about if you can fix the problem. Then
        branch off from your answers . For example if you can't do anything
        about it then let it go. If you can then aske yourself when it comes
        up, what is it, and the how behind it and branch off until you find
        solutions to the worry.
        Monitor Eating and Sleep Patterns
        Diet and sleep can effect your minds in many different ways. Sleep
        can make you more tired. Being tired you are more likely to make
        mistakes making you feel less of yourself. Healthy dieting can help
        give your brain the help it needs to think clearly and make positive
        decisions. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water and eating
        plenty of veggies and fruit. Eating excess sugar will slow your brain
        down and make you feel drowsy.

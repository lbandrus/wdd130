            <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Logan Andrus. I am a Computer Science Major and would like to be a software developer one day. I love to swim and rock climb. I come from a big family. I have 4 brothers and 2 sisters. I am not married. I am currently a classroom facilitator for Utah State University at the Tooele campus. I love how affordable BYU-I is.            I am taking this class because it is required but I also want to learn how to build on what I already know about making websites. I am not much of a front-end programmer. I have been a member of the church my whole life. My 5x great grandpa was actually the right hand man to Brigham Young. My family is the 4th largest family in the church. My favorite scripture is Alma 32: 21 <i>"And now as I said concerning faithâ€”afaith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye bhope for things which are cnot seen, which are true."</i></p>
